## How It Works

1. The scraper fetches live news data from online sources.
2. Each article is passed through:
   - Sentiment analyzer (VADER)
   - Topic classifier (Naive Bayes)
3. The processed news is stored in Firebase.
4. The Flutter frontend displays news in real-time with categories and sentiment labels.
5. Users can sign in, filter by topic or sentiment, and get live updates.
